## Project Title:  Flower Recognition (Using Supervised Learning Models)

Flowers, which come in an amazing variety of hues, forms, and sizes, are an essential component of our natural world. In addition to being beautiful, they are crucial for ecosystems, horticulture, agriculture, and botanical study. The ability to classify and identify flowers automatically has broad ramifications, from assisting botanists and gardeners in their job to enabling e-commerce platforms and contributing to biodiversity protection.
So, we selected ‘Flower Recognition’ using deep learning as our problem statement. To automatically recognise and categorise flowers based on their visual characteristics, deep learning is a cutting-edge application of artificial intelligence (AI) and computer vision techniques.
We used LeNet architecture, AlexNet architecture, ResNet architecture and VGG16 architecture for this flower recognition process under supervised learning.
